	<h1><a href="index.html">raf</a>/OBEXFTP and the elusive error code 64</h1>
	



<div id="content">
<p class=" article_preamble">I was trying to push some files into my Nokia this morning and failed miserably at it ...</p>
<p>For a while now I've been getting used to see KDE's bluedeviz fail in some curious manner, specially when I use it from other desktop environments.
One google search and one manpage later, I decided to try to send the file from the command line, using</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>hcitool scan
...
obexftp -b &lt;Bluetooth Addr&gt; -p &lt;filename&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>All this seemed pretty straightforward, except for the fact that obexftp failed
with the following message:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ obexftp -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -p file.pdf
Browsing XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX ...
Connecting..<span class="se">\d</span>one
Tried to connect <span class="k">for</span> 29ms
Sending <span class="s2">&quot;file.pdf&quot;</span>.../failed: file.pdf
The operation failed with <span class="k">return</span> code 64
Disconnecting..-done
</pre></div>


<p>Now if that is not cryptic, I don't know what is. I have no idea what "error code 64" is supposed to be (although perror treats it a network error) and Google doesn't seem to be very helpful on this.
For some reason I can not explain, I decided to backtrack and try to force the bluetooth channel that obexftp should use. I did a scan for services and found my phone's OBEX File Transfer service in channel 4:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ sdptool browse
...
Service Name: OBEX File Transfer
Service RecHandle: 0x10007
Service Class ID List:
  <span class="s2">&quot;OBEX File Transfer&quot;</span> <span class="o">(</span>0x1106<span class="o">)</span>
Protocol Descriptor List:
  <span class="s2">&quot;L2CAP&quot;</span> <span class="o">(</span>0x0100<span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;RFCOMM&quot;</span> <span class="o">(</span>0x0003<span class="o">)</span>
    Channel: 4
  <span class="s2">&quot;OBEX&quot;</span> <span class="o">(</span>0x0008<span class="o">)</span>
...
</pre></div>


<p>And changed the obexftp command to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ obexftp -b XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -B <span class="m">4</span> -p file.pdf
</pre></div>


<p>and it succeeded :D. Hell if I have any idea why obexftp is sending files to the wrong channel.</p>
