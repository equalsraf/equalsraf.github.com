	<h1><a href="index.html">raf</a>/Booting Raspberry Pi Root in read-only</h1>
	



<div id="content">
<p class=" article_preamble">So last week a lot of people around here were looking into how to boot a raspberry pi with
the SD card partition in read only mode - this came after a couple of annoying
data losses.</p>
<p>A lot of us are using the R-Pi as cheap automation system - 
as terminal(tty) server, 3D print server, server monitoring, and more ideas are
constantly on the way in.  Personally I use it as a media center attached to my
TV.</p>
<p>The main problem with this kind of use are that the devices are constantly on, and might have
to suffer trough power failures - <em>For my part I'm ready to admit that I've
pulled the plug a couple times</em>.</p>
<p>So I wanted to have a way to keep the root partition as read only, thus avoiding corruption
on the SD Card. I can always plug in some USB storage if I need it, and in some cases there
really is no need for persistent storage of any kind.</p>
<p>The following are a set of steps to accomplish this on Arch Linux (2013-05-14.img), if you use
Raspbian instead check the references at the end for a working solution.</p>
<h3>1. Mount the root partition as read-only (ro) on boot</h3>
<p>In raspberry pi the root partition flags can be set as kernel parameters in
/boot/cmdline.txt. You should add an <strong>ro</strong> flag right after the <strong>root=</strong> parameter.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>selinux=0 plymouth.enable=0 smsc95xx.turbo_mode=N dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ro rootfstype=ext4 elevator=noop rootwait
</pre></div>


<h3>2. Find a new location for resolv.conf</h3>
<p>The /etc/resolv.conf file stores the list of DNS nameservers your machine
uses, if it is not writable it will be empty and applications won't be able
to resolve names.</p>
<p>I've moved mine into /tmp/ (which is a tmpfs partition by default):</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># rm /etc/resolv.conf
# ln -s /tmp/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
</pre></div>


<h3>3. Mount /var/{tmp, log} as tmpfs</h3>
<p>The /var/tmp directory is used to store temporary files, and the /var/log for system logfiles.</p>
<p>You can mount these two as tmpfs by adding the following to /etc/fstab</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>tmpfs   /var/log    tmpfs   nodev,nosuid    0   0
tmpfs   /var/tmp    tmpfs   nodev,nosuid    0   0
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that I did not make a symbolic link between /var/tmp and /tmp. This is
intentional, doing so seems to trigger a bug with systemd - search for <em>step
NAMESPACE</em> to find some references.</p>
<h3>4. Disable some systemd services</h3>
<p>Systemd has a couple of services that can be disabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>systemd-readahead does some optimisations based on disk access patterns</li>
<li>systemd-random-seed stores entropy information between reboots</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be disabled via systemctl</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># systemctl disable systemd-readahead-collect
# ...
# systemctl disable systemd-random-seed
</pre></div>


<h3>5. Replace syslog-ng with rsyslog</h3>
<p><em>syslog-ng</em> will not run if /var/lib is not writeable (it stores persistent data there), so I've
removed it and started using rsyslog instead.</p>
<h3>6. Disable ntpd and use a netctl hook instead</h3>
<p>By default Arch will sync time on boot using ntpd (if an internet connection is available).
This is a problem for the Raspberry Pi because it has no internal clock, and if
a connection is not immediatly available, <em>ntpd</em> might take while to sync.</p>
<p>Personally I've had better results in setting a hook to update the
time whenever a new connection is available. The following works using dhcpcd
in <em>/usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks/50-ntp</em></p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/sh</span>
<span class="k">case</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">reason</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span> in
    BOUND<span class="p">|</span>INFORM<span class="p">|</span>REBIND<span class="p">|</span>REBOOT<span class="p">|</span>RENEW<span class="p">|</span>TIMEOUT<span class="p">|</span>STATIC<span class="o">)</span>
        <span class="c1"># &quot;-g&quot; allows for large time differences</span>
        ntpd -qg
        <span class="p">;;</span>
<span class="k">esac</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Now you can disable the ntpd daemon</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># systemctl disable ntpd
</pre></div>


<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>The system will start in read-only mode, whenever I need to write into the root
I remount the root as read-write and then back:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span># mount -o rw,remount /
# pacman &lt;...&gt;
# mount -o ro,remount
</pre></div>


<p>Keep an eye out for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some services really need to write to /var/lib, dhcpcd will complain about the leases
  but otherwise it works, others might not work at all (syslog-ng)</li>
<li>I've mounted /var/log as tmpfs, there is probably a better way to do this
  such as using ramlog, or logging into a remote system</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally you don't have to do it exactly like this, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a separate writeable partition</li>
<li>Write to USB flash drive</li>
</ul>
<p>It really depends on your setup.</p>
