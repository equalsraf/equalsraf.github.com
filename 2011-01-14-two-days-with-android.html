	<h1><a href="index.html">raf</a>/2 days with Android</h1>
	



<div id="content">
<p class=" article_preamble">After being annoyed with some show-stopping bugs at work, I decided to take two days
out of my life and tackle a major Bluetooth related BUG() we had in our Android application. 
Being the first time I tried to develop for android I was concerned I would have to use 
Eclipse, and loose my Vim-powered productivity. </p>
<p>So here's a short primer on console based development for Android</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Being a happy openSUSE user, android packages were already available. Replace
the following with the appropriate (apt-get, yum) commands, or download the
SDK from the android website.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ sudo zypper install android-sdk
$ kdesu android
</pre></div>


<p>A nice enough GUI will open and you will be able to update the SDK and install
additional components.</p>
<h2>Starting adb</h2>
<p>To run code on the device you need to start the adb daemon. I 
do it as root, but you should probably setup some rules in udev to set
appropriate usb permissions.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ adb kill-server
$ sudo adb start-server
$ adb devices
</pre></div>


<h2>Lets create a project</h2>
<p>To create a project in the current folder:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ android create project --target  <span class="m">1</span>  --path . --package com.example.Test --activity MyAndroidAppActivity
</pre></div>


<p>The arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Target(1) : Depends on your installation, check <strong>android list</strong></li>
<li>Path(.) : The target path, in this case <strong>.</strong>, the current directory</li>
<li>Package(com.example.Test) : The Java package for your source code</li>
<li>Activity(MyAndroidAppActivity) : The name of the main activity class</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling and running code</h2>
<p>Android projects use <strong>ant</strong> to build the source and install it into the device. 
The following commands will compile, install and run the application in a plugged
Android device:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ ant compile
$ ant install
$ adb shell <span class="s1">&#39;am start -n com.example.Test/.MyAndroidAppActivity&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Sometimes it is also useful to remove an application from the phone:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ adb uninstall com.example.Test
</pre></div>


<h2>Logging and Debugging</h2>
<p>One of my favourite parts so far in developing for android is the debugging
logs. You can see a live log of what is happening in your device:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ adb logcat
</pre></div>


<p>or if you want to restrict it to a single application and log level:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ adb logcat -s MyActivity:V
</pre></div>


<p>If you are like me you'll want to keep track of stacktraces on the log.
Here's a treat:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">logTrace</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">StackTraceElement</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">trace</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">trace</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">length</span><span class="o">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
     <span class="n">Log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">v</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getClass</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">getName</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="n">trace</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">].</span><span class="na">toString</span><span class="o">());</span>          
    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
    <span class="n">logTrace</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getStackTrace</span><span class="o">());</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>A brief Conclusion</h2>
<p>All in all not a bad development environment for the console. I admit I didn't
handle enough GUI development to miss the designer in eclipse, but still with 3 console
commands you are mostly ready to run your own app on the device. Which is more than can be 
said for several other development environments.</p>
<p>While the development environment was fine, I was pissed at the Java APIs. It
seems Bluetooth support in Android <em>sucks</em>, no Secure Simple Pairing, little to no control
over Bluetooth sockets other than the ability to <em>close</em> them, and the wretched 
<em>createRfcommSocketToServiceRecord(UUID)</em> method that does not seem to work.</p>
<p>Finally, I also took an hour to peek at native development with the android NDK, and I
wasn't particularly pleased about it, it has but the most basic libraries (libc, libz, etc), just
enough to optimise some heavy duty computation but useless for almost anything else. Things
like libbluetooth were sorely missed.</p>
<p>Not a bad way to spend two days, I actually got a lot done, which is lot to say about any 
first time use of any development environment. I like some of the concepts behind
Android development (Activities, AsyncTask), others not so much (Dialogs :S).</p>
<h3>PS: some extra bits I picked up later</h3>
<p>If for any reason you lost you build.xml, just ask adb to rebuild it.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ android update project  --path . --target &lt;TARGET&gt;
</pre></div>


<p>To open a browser from the adb shell:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>$ am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -n com.android.browser/.BrowserActivity http://www.raf.im
</pre></div>
